# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] I have reviewed the [lecture / discsussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal

Serve Central is fully functional web and mobile application designed to make volunteering easier. The application provides users with geographic locations of volunteer events near them, allows the user to sign up to volunteer straight on the app, and collects statistics of their volunteer efforts.
